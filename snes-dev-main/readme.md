# SNES Development

This is the example code for my series of tutorials on SNES development. I recommend reading the [accompanying tutorials](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/snes-dev-1-getting-started) on my blog.

Please note:

> The example code will be kept brutally simple, to the point of maybe even being a little gross. This is to encourage you to make your own copy of it, edit it, and make it your own. I recommend copying the code from part one, and then applying the changes in each new part manually, so that you can clean things up and move things around as you go. In each section, I'll link both to the complete code, and to a diff from the previous part.
